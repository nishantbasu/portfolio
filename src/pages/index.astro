        <b>"I know even less than I knew yesterday, but I'll figure it out tomorrow."</b></br>
        I love taking on new projects, experimenting with new stacks, and refining my approach to find the best solution for each unique problem. I then try forget what I learned to give my brain some room for newer things. I believe in learning fast and unlearning even faster. In the fast-paced tech world, this belief works quite well; I'm the person who gets the job done quickly and effectively.</br>
      </br>I'm a master's in computer science student at <b>Texas A&M</b>, previously a Senior Software Engineer at <b>Dell</b>. 
        At Dell, I optimized user experiences for checkout systems of global e-commerce <b>dell.com</b>, worked on micro frontends with languages like Typescript, Javascript and frameworks like LitElement.
      </br>
        I also managed 30+ Rest APIs and microservices based out of C# and ASP.net Core. I took care of Infrastructure, CI/CD health, deployments and stability.
    </br>
        
        Beyond that, I freelanced with Curebay, building a logistics platform serving 1500+ orders daily.
      </br>ðŸ’¼ <b>Seeking Summer 2025 Internships</b></br>
      Currently I am experimenting with Machine Learning and trying to understand the field with my coursework.
      I'm on the lookout for an <b>internship</b> starting <b>May 2025</b> where I can bring this spirit of curiosity and resilience to a new team. If you're looking for someone who's eager to adapt, explore, and contribute to meaningful projects, I'd love to connect!
